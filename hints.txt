These are hints to remind me (the developer) how to work with github, pypi, etc.

To upload to github, just use regular git commands.  The readme.md file will update on the site automatically.

git add --all
git commit -am 'message'
git push origin master

To upload to pypi:

- change the __init__.py file -> __version__ =
python setup.py sdist upload
- remove the extra files/dirs it created (like dist/)
rm -rf dist/ django_mako_plus.egg-info/
