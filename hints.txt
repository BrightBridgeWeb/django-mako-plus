These are hints to remind me (the developer) how to work with github, pypi, etc.

To upload to github, just use regular git commands.  The readme.md file will update on the site automatically.

git add --all
git commit -am 'message'
git push origin master

To upload to pypi:

python setup.py sdist upload

Then don't forget to remove the build, dist, MANIFEST, etc.
