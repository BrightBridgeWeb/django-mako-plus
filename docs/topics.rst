Advanced Topics
==========================


The following sections explore the capabilities of DMP beyond the tutorials.  If you haven't gone through the tutorial yet, come back for these goodies later.

After the topics, the following are further destinations to learn Mako and Django:

- Go through the `Mako Templates <http://www.makotemplates.org/>`__ documentation. It will explain all the constructs you can use in your html templates.
- Read or reread the `Django Tutorial <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`__. Just remember as you see the tutorial's Django template code (usually surrounded by ``{{ }}``) that you'll be using Mako syntax instead (``${ }``).
- Link to this project in your blog or online comments. I'd love to see the Django people come around to the idea that Python isn't evil inside templates. Complex Python might be evil, but Python itself is just a tool within templates.
