Tutorials
==========================

To quote the Django's docs, "Let's learn by example."

After installation, this is the best place to be.  The examples presented here show the basics of DMP, and they aren't repeated in the Topic sections.

    tutorial_meet_dmp
    tutorial_views
    tutorial_urlparams
    tutorial_css_js
    tutorial_ajax

Although I agree that T2 was the best movie in the series (although personally, I *loved* the twist at the end of the underrated T3), my favorite part of the tutorial is T4 (css and js).
