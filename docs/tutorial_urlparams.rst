T3: Pretty URL Parameters
===================================


Django is all about pretty URLs. In keeping with that philosophy, this framework has URL parameters. We've already used the first two items in the path: the first specifies the app, the second specifies the view/template. URL parameters are the third part, fourth part, and so on.

In traditional web links, you'd specify parameters using key=value pairs, as in ``/homepage/index?first=abc&second=def``. That's ugly, of course, and it's certainly not the Django way (it does still work, though).
